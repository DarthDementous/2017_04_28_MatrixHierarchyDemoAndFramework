Dear Marc,

As you'll probably be able to tell from this project I completely run out of time.

I over-stretched myself because I really wanted to challenge myself and delve deeper into 3D but my own stubborness didn't let me see that I could've pushed myself with 2D AND still produced
a quality submission.

Almost everything I wanted to include is implemented but does not work properly. For example, the collision is completely bugged because I couldn't figure out how to properly transform the min
and max coordinates, and the camera almost works as intended. Frustratingly the unit test didn't check that my Matrix4 * Vector4 operator was wrong so that was a last ditch effort to save that
feature.

In terms of things that work relatively well the interactive physics (WASD + SPACE) I implemented seem to work decently; the friction, gravity and bouncing. It doesn't fulfill nearly enough of the criteria though so I'm
prepared to take the hit mark-wise to at least learn to walk before I run.

Regards,

Sebastian
